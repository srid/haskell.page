How can I fix this? I could give up on the nixification of the project and just use stack, but I&#39;d prefer not to.

I&#39;m a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. 

For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called &quot;composable functions&quot; (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.

The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it&#39;s inputs change.

Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.

So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!

This is a fascinating idea to me, and I&#39;d love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).

I know there&#39;s gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.

Does anyone know of anyone who&#39;s attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?</div></div></div><div class="flex-1 max-h-32 overflow-auto text-gray-300 hover:text-gray-800" title="Submission

We are thrilled to announce the release of Ogma, a new open-source NASA tool, written in Haskell, to generate hard-realtime C runtime monitoring applications from high-level specifications.

Ogma takes the output of existing tools, like NASA&#39;s requirements elicitation tool FRET \[2\], and produces monitors in Copilot \[3\], a runtime verification language that can be compiled to hard-realtime C99.

Ogma is also able to produce monitoring applications for NASA&#39;s Core Flight System (cFS), which can be compiled alongside existing applications to flag requirement violations.

This is research software (Class E) and it has not been certified for use in aircraft or UAVs. We are currently using it for upcoming experiments at NASA Langley.

We&#39;d like to also take this opportunity to publicly thank the team that creates BNFC, for their tool, their response to technical questions during the development of Ogma, and for accommodations made to help us speed up our release process.

If you have any issues, feel free to open a ticket in the github repo directly.

There is some text that I don&#39;t care about...
...
&amp;lt;actual text that I want to parse and insert some texts before or after&amp;gt;

Maybe more irrelevant text.

I tried using `getPosition` and `setPosition` but it didn&#39;t behave like I expected, maybe I am using them wrong?

Any advice would be appreciated.

I have to use both recursion &amp;amp; guards, so this is what I came up with. The problem now is that somehow the just (negate count) in the test&#39; function doesn&#39;t work (it always returns the result as positive, eg dividedBy&#39;&#39; (-100) 10 is always Just 10) - and I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out why. I checked that the test&#39; function does indeed get called, I triple checked my guards etc. Any help would be much appreciated :)\n\n    dividedBy&#39;&#39; :: Int -&amp;gt; Int -&amp;gt; Maybe Int\n    dividedBy&#39;&#39; num denom\n       | denom == 0 = Nothing\n       | num &amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; denom &amp;gt; 0 = test&#39; (negate num) denom 0\n       | num &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; denom &amp;lt; 0 = test&#39; num (negate denom) 0\n       | num &amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; denom &amp;lt; 0 = go (negate num) (negate denom) 0\n       | num &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; denom &amp;gt; 0 = go num denom 0\n          where go n d count\n                  | n &amp;lt; d = Just count\n                  | otherwise = go (n - d) d (count + 1)\n                test&#39; n d count\n                  | n &amp;lt; d = Just (negate count) -- why does this not work?? ffs\n                  | otherwise = go (n - d) d (count + 1)&quot;
